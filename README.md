# Amazon_Clone

This project is a static clone of the Amazon homepage built using only HTML and CSS. It features a navigation bar with a logo, search bar, and links, followed by a hero banner and product section. The layout is visually structured to resemble the look and feel of the original Amazon website. Product cards showcase different categories with images and offers. The design is clean, responsive, and styled to provide a real e-commerce website appearance. Itâ€™s perfect for practicing front-end layout and styling.
